# Maze-Game
In here the maze is stored to csv file, where the bricks and paths are represented by 0 and 1, respectively. The starting point and the destination is marked with ‘S’ and ‘D’, respectively. A small robot is moving from Starting point to the Destination and it can view four adjacent squares from its position. The robot can move either left, right, top, or bottom directions and a one square at a time. Programme was developed to move the robot from Starting point to Destination. The motion of the robot in each step was printed to the screen and one second delay was kept between each step.

S - starting point

D - destination

R - robot

0 - bricks

. - road

Once the robot reach the destination, the correct path with was printed ‘+’ sign in the map and dedvelooped by python.
